Creating a complete IoT and machine learning-based smart inventory management system is quite an extensive project. However, I can provide a simplified version in Python that simulates some core functionalities. It includes:

1. **Real-time tracking**: This can be simulated with random stock updates.
2. **Machine Learning prediction**: For simplicity, we'll use a linear regression model to predict future demand based on past data.
3. **Automated reordering**: Automatically reorder stock when levels run low.

This example uses Python's `pandas` for data handling, `numpy` for numerical operations, and `scikit-learn` for the machine learning model. You'll need to have these packages installed (`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn`).

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import random
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Mock function to simulate real-time stock updates
def update_stock(stock_data):
    # Randomly increase or decrease stock
    stock_change = random.randint(-5, 5)
    logging.info(f"Stock changed by: {stock_change}")
    stock_data += stock_change
    stock_data = max(stock_data, 0)  # Ensure stock isn't negative
    return stock_data

# Example inventory data, with historical records of stock levels
historical_data = {
    'day': np.arange(1, 11),
    'stock_levels': [100, 95, 92, 89, 90, 85, 80, 76, 80, 78]
}

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(historical_data)

# Machine learning part: Predict future demand
def predict_demand(df):
    X = df['day'].values.reshape(-1, 1)
    y = df['stock_levels'].values
    model = LinearRegression()
    
    try:
        # Train model
        model.fit(X, y)
        future_day = np.array([[len(df) + 1]])
        predicted_demand = model.predict(future_day)
        logging.info(f"Predicted stock level for next day: {predicted_demand[0]}")
        return predicted_demand[0]
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in predicting demand: {e}")
        return None

# Automated reordering logic
def reorder_logic(current_stock, predicted_stock, reorder_threshold=70):
    try:
        if predicted_stock < reorder_threshold:
            order_amount = reorder_threshold - current_stock
            logging.info(f"Reordering {order_amount} units of stock.")
        else:
            logging.info("Stock level is sufficient, no need to reorder.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in reordering logic: {e}")

# Simulation loop
stock_level = 78
for day in range(11, 21):
    logging.info(f"Day {day} - Current stock level: {stock_level}")
    
    # Update stock level
    stock_level = update_stock(stock_level)
    
    # Add to historical data
    new_data = pd.DataFrame({'day': [day], 'stock_levels': [stock_level]})
    df = pd.concat([df, new_data], ignore_index=True)
    
    # Predict demand for the next day
    next_day_prediction = predict_demand(df)
    
    # Run reorder logic
    reorder_logic(stock_level, next_day_prediction)

# Note: This is a simplification and simulation, actual implementation would involve 
# IoT device communication, real-time data streaming, and a more sophisticated machine 
# learning model and data pipeline.
```

### Key Points:

- **Real-Time Stock Updates**: The `update_stock` function randomly changes the stock level to simulate real-time inventory changes.
- **ML Prediction**: We use linear regression (`LinearRegression`) to predict future stock needs based on historical data.
- **Reordering Process**: If the predicted stock level falls below a certain threshold, the system decides to reorder stock.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is provided using try-except blocks and logging.

This program is a basic simulation of a smart inventory system. Implementing this in a real-world scenario requires hardware integrations for IoT, real-time data processing, a database system for historical data storage and retrieval, more sophisticated predictive models, and potentially a web service for interactions.
